                            <p id = aboutMe>Hey there, welcome to my site! My name is Neshua, I am a recent Macalester College graduate with a 
                                B.A in Computer Science and a minor in Data Science. I was born in San Pedro Sula, Honduras 
                                but have been living in Illinois for the past 10 years. I have an 8-year old brother and a 2-year old dog named Bruno! Like many people my age, I have been interested and skilled in computers 
                                and technology from a very young age. I fell in love with programming my freshman year of college and knew right away that I wanted to develop a career in CS.
                                The 2020 pandemic reinforced my desire to work in tech as we all began relying on computers for most of our every-day tasks. 
                                I am skilled in machine learning, data visualization, web development and various programming languages. I am currently working as a 
                                Technical Support Assistant for Rockford's Public School District and I am eager to continue to grow my expertise in the tech field! Before that, I
                                interned at Surest Insurance, designing and implementing performance tests, and developing automated tests. I 
                                also served as a Preceptor for Macalester College's Computer Science department, guiding students in database management systems.
                                While in College, I also worked as a College Access Organizer at Macalester's Civic Engagement Center, facilitating college visits for first-gen BIPOC students in grades 4-12, fostering access to higher education and
                                empowering underrepresented communities. I am commited to making college access easier and ecouraging fellow underrepresented students
                                to demand a spot in the tech space.
