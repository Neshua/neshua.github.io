                            <p id = aboutMe>Hello! My name is Neshua Aguilar, I am senior student at Macalester College pursuing a 
                                Computer Science Major and Data Science minor. I was born in San Pedro Sula, Honduras 
                                but moved to Roscoe, Illinois about 10 years ago. I have a 7 year old brother and a 1yr old dog named Bruno! I have always been interested in computers 
                                and technology in general. I took my first ever Computer Science course my freshman year of college and pretty much knew right away that I wanted to keep programming as a potential career path.
                                The pandemic also reinforced my desire to work in tech as we all began relying on computers for most of our every-day tasks. I have also always loved video games, so my ideal job would be working in game development. 
                                The video game industry can be a hard place to get into, but I am determined to work hard and earn a spot in the field. In the meantime, I would love to work in UX design and
                                and front-end web development. I am currently an intern at Surest, a Minneapolis based United Health Care company previously known as Bind Benefits. I am working as a 
                                QA automation engineer. I am also a Community Engagement Organizer at Macalester's Civic Engagement Center.
