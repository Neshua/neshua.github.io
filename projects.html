                                Pic-2-Songs is a web application program that uses convlutional neural networks, natural language processing and 
                                data filtering to recommend two songs based on a user's image's mood. The program uses deep learning and an image captioning model
                                to first create a text description of the image, the text is then analyzed through IBM Watson's natural language understanding API 
                                and given an emotion classification and an emotion score, this emotion classification and score is then used alongside a spotify dataset 
                                to find the songs that best fit the emotion pr sentiment of the image.

                            <p class="projectParagraphs">This is an end of class project I worked on for my Data Structures class. It is a two level tic-tac-toe game where the player
                                can choose what tile to play (either "X" or "O"), if they would like to play first or let the computer go first. 
                                And finally the level of difficulty they would like to play at.
